It comes wrapped in aluminum and carbon fiber body panels, and packs dual rear-mounted motors that generate over 600 horsepower with 700 pound-feet of torque. That should enable a 0-60 mph time under four seconds; top speed is 155 mph. Itâ€™s expected to run for over 200 miles on a charge. Production will be limited to 155 units and it should cost around $260,000.</q></p>
